# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢💥

## Project Description 📊
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and others. The project steps include:
1. **Data Cleaning 🧹** – Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the data for machine learning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍** – Visual exploration and analysis of data to discover trends, relationships, and patterns.
3. **Machine Learning Model 🤖** – Implementing a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict survival based on the data features. The model is trained and evaluated, and predictions are made on new data.
4. **Insights and Conclusion 💡** – The final output includes performance metrics, insights from the data, and conclusions.

## Technologies Used 💻
The following tools and technologies were used to complete this project:

- **Python 🐍**: Programming language for the data pipeline, machine learning model, and analysis.
- **Pandas 📦**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn 🔧**: Machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier).
- **Jupyter Notebook 📓**: Interactive environment to run code, analyze data, and document the process.
- **NumPy 🔢**: Numerical operations.
- **Kaggle Titanic Dataset 🛳️**: The dataset used for analysis and model training.

## Dataset 📋
The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains information about Titanic passengers, including:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Pclass**: The class of the passenger (1, 2, or 3).
- **Name**: The passenger’s name.
- **Sex**: The passenger’s gender.
- **Age**: The passenger’s age.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).

## Visualizations 📊✨
In this project, several types of visualizations were created:
- **Bar plots 📊** for categorical data (e.g., sex, passenger class).
- **Histograms 📈** for continuous data (e.g., age, fare).
- **Heatmaps 🔥** to observe correlations between features.
- **Pair plots 🔗** to examine relationships between pairs of features.
- **Box plots 📦** to detect outliers in continuous variables.
- **Violin plots 🎻** to visualize distributions grouped by categorical variables.

## Usage 🏁
After running the Jupyter notebook, follow the instructions inside the notebook to understand how the data is cleaned, visualized, and used for training the machine learning model. You can also change the dataset or parameters to explore different results.
