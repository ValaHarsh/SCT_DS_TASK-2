# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Description
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and others. The project steps include:
1. **Data Cleaning** – Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the data for machine learning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visual exploration and analysis of data to discover trends, relationships, and patterns.
3. **Machine Learning Model** – Implementing a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict survival based on the data features. The model is trained and evaluated, and predictions are made on new data.
4. **Insights and Conclusion** – The final output includes performance metrics, insights from the data, and conclusions.

## Technologies Used
The following tools and technologies were used to complete this project:

- **Python**: Programming language for the data pipeline, machine learning model, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment to run code, analyze data, and document the process.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Kaggle Titanic Dataset**: The dataset used for analysis and model training.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains information about Titanic passengers, including:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Pclass**: The class of the passenger (1, 2, or 3).
- **Name**: The passenger’s name.
- **Sex**: The passenger’s gender.
- **Age**: The passenger’s age.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).

## Visualizations
In this project, several types of visualizations were created:
- **Bar plots** for categorical data (e.g., sex, passenger class).
- **Histograms** for continuous data (e.g., age, fare).
- **Heatmaps** to observe correlations between features.
- **Pair plots** to examine relationships between pairs of features.
- **Box plots** to detect outliers in continuous variables.
- **Violin plots** to visualize distributions grouped by categorical variables.
